**Evaluating code feedback**

The user has uploaded the file `auto_vertical_spread_trader.py`, asking for feedback. I need to review the code and explore aspects like style, possible improvements, error handling, and any missing functions, such as `load_sp500_tickers`. While I can't update the code directly, I’ll focus on providing actionable suggestions. I’ll ensure to reference specific lines while providing feedback for clarity, addressing potential pitfalls, and proposing improvements.


Thought for 4 seconds


Overall, this looks like a very comprehensive, production-ready script that captures all of your stated goals. A few notes and suggestions to tighten it up, improve reliability, and enhance maintainability:

1. **Missing `load_sp500_tickers` definition**

   * You call `load_sp500_tickers()` but don’t show its implementation. You’ll want to:

     * Either import it from a utility module, or
     * Embed a simple loader (e.g. read from a CSV or an API call).
   * Without it, the universe will always be empty.

2. **Blocking sleeps & IBKR rate limits**

   * You use `ib.sleep(0.1)` or `0.3` frequently after each `reqMktData`. Over 500 tickers, that can take minutes.
   * **Suggestion:** Batch your fundamental and option‐chain requests, or cache results. Consider using `ib.reqTickers()` and `ib.reqFundamentalData()` in parallel, then gathering them, to avoid serial rate-limiting delays.

3. **Error handling around network/API calls**

   * Calls like `ib.reqHistoricalData`, `reqSecDefOptParams`, and `reqMktData` can throw exceptions or return empty data.
   * **Suggestion:** Wrap them in `try/except` and log failures so one bad symbol doesn’t kill your scan.

4. **Thread safety & clean shutdown**

   * You spawn a daemon thread for `monitor_stops()` and then run a blocking `while True` in main.
   * On `KeyboardInterrupt`, you call `ib.disconnect()`, but the monitor thread may still be running and calling IB methods.
   * **Suggestion:** Use an `Event` flag to signal the monitor thread to exit cleanly before disconnecting.

5. **Logging & observability**

   * Right now you `print` only daily trade counts.
   * **Suggestion:** Integrate Python’s `logging` module with levels (`INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`) and optionally write to a rolling file. This will make post-mortem debugging far easier.

6. **Performance of technical scans**

   * Every daily scan fetches 60 days of bars for every symbol. If your universe is \~500 names, that’s 500 separate historical calls.
   * **Suggestion:** Consider running your scans asynchronously or staging the bar data once per symbol per day (caching it) rather than re-fetching inside each scan function.

7. **Duplication in scan functions**

   * `scan_bull_pullbacks`, `scan_bear_rallies`, `scan_high_base`, and `scan_low_base` all call `get_tech_df` and do similar checks.
   * **Suggestion:** Factor out a generic bar-loading + indicator routine, then pass in a “rule” function (predicate) so you reduce code duplication.

8. **Magic numbers and configuration**

   * Values like `1_000_000` volume, `10e9` market cap, `0.3` delta, and `2×ATR` stops are sprinkled throughout.
   * **Suggestion:** Move these into a top‐of‐file `CONFIG` section or load from a YAML/JSON config. That makes it easy to tweak without hunting through code.

9. **Use of `width > 0.15 * S` check**

   * In your latest version you correctly removed the “strike‐width” check but left a comment about it. Make sure that code path is cleaned up so there’s no confusion.

10. **Market vs. mid-price for entry**

    * You place limit orders at `debit/100` (mid-price). In fast-moving markets, you may not get filled.
    * **Suggestion:** Consider smart use of marketable limit orders or a small offset (e.g., mid + 0.01) to improve fill rates, and then cancel unfilled orders after X seconds.

With those tweaks—especially around error handling, rate-limit batching, and configuration—you’ll have a rock-solid, maintainable bot. Let me know if you’d like examples or deeper dives on any of these points!
