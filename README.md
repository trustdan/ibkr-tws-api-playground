A modular, production-ready system for automated vertical spread trading with Interactive Brokers.

## Overview

This system scans for technical setups on S&P 500 stocks and trades vertical option spreads based on four strategies:

1. **Bull Pullbacks** - Long call verticals on bullish stocks pulling back to 50-day MA
2. **Bear Rallies** - Long put verticals on bearish stocks rallying to 50-day MA
3. **High Base** - Long call verticals on stocks consolidating near 52-week highs
4. **Low Base** - Long put verticals on stocks consolidating near 52-week lows

All trades include automated stop losses based on ATR.

## Features

- **Fundamental Filtering**: Market cap â‰¥ $10B, price > $20, optionable stocks
- **Technical Analysis**: 50 DMA trend analysis, volume filtering, consolidation patterns
- **Option Selection**: Delta-based strike selection, cost limits, R:R ratio enforcement
- **Risk Management**: ATR-based stop losses, position limits, daily trade limits
- **Execution**: Late-day trade entries, clean reconnection handling, email alerts

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Interactive Brokers account with TWS or IB Gateway
- TA-Lib (technical analysis library)

## Installation

### 1. Installing TA-Lib

TA-Lib is a critical dependency for this system and requires a two-step installation: the C library must be installed first, followed by the Python wrapper.

#### Platform-Specific One-Liners

The simplest installation method depends on your operating system:

**Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y libta-lib-dev && pip install TA-Lib
```

**macOS:**
```bash
brew install ta-lib && pip install TA-Lib
```

**Windows:**
```bash
# Download the wheel appropriate for your Python version (e.g., for Python 3.9, 64-bit)
pip install TA_Lib-0.4.27-cp39-cp39-win_amd64.whl 
```
(Download the wheel file first from [Christoph Gohlke's repository](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#ta-lib))

#### Verifying Your Installation

To check if TA-Lib is properly installed (works on all platforms):

```bash
python -c "import talib; print('TA-Lib installed successfully! Functions:', talib.get_functions()[:3])"
```

If this returns a list of function names (like `['ADX', 'ADXR', 'APO']`), your installation is working correctly.

#### Automated Installation: Bootstrap Script

For a guided installation that handles your specific environment, we provide a bootstrap script:

```bash
# Clone the repository if you haven't already
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/auto-vertical-spread-trader.git
cd auto-vertical-spread-trader

# Make the script executable
chmod +x scripts/bootstrap_talib.sh

# Run the bootstrap script
./scripts/bootstrap_talib.sh
```

This script will:
- Detect your operating system
- Install necessary dependencies (using system packages when available)
- Set up TA-Lib appropriately for your platform
- Verify the installation works correctly

#### Detailed Installation Instructions

If you need more control over the installation process:

##### Ubuntu/Debian
```bash
# Install the C library and development headers
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y libta-lib-dev

# Install the Python wrapper
pip install TA-Lib
```

##### macOS
Using Homebrew:
```bash
# Install the C library
brew install ta-lib

# Install the Python wrapper
pip install TA-Lib
```

##### Windows

1. **Using pre-built wheels** (recommended):
   - Download the appropriate wheel from [Christoph Gohlke's repository](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#ta-lib)
   - Select the version matching your Python version and architecture (e.g., `TA_Lib-0.4.27-cp39-cp39-win_amd64.whl`)
   - Install with pip:
     ```
     pip install TA_Lib-0.4.27-cp39-cp39-win_amd64.whl
     ```

2. **Building from source**:
   - Download TA-Lib C library from [TA-Lib.org](https://ta-lib.org/hdr_dw.html)
   - Unzip to `C:\ta-lib`
   - Add to environment variables: `LIB` path should include `C:\ta-lib\lib`, and `INCLUDE` should include `C:\ta-lib\include`
   - Install the Python wrapper: `pip install ta-lib`

### 2. Installing the Package

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/auto-vertical-spread-trader.git
   cd auto-vertical-spread-trader
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Verify TA-Lib installation:
   ```python
   python -c "import talib; print('TA-Lib installed successfully!')"
   ```

## Configuration

Edit `config.py` to adjust parameters:

- Connection settings (`IB_HOST`, `IB_PORT`)
- Risk parameters (`MAX_POSITIONS`, `MAX_DAILY_TRADES`)
- Strategy parameters (ATR multiples, delta thresholds)
- Email alerts (optional)

### Key Configuration Options

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `MAX_POSITIONS` | 10 | Maximum open positions allowed |
| `MAX_DAILY_TRADES` | 2 | Maximum new trades per day |
| `MIN_DELTA` | 0.30 | Minimum option delta for spreads |
| `MAX_DELTA` | 0.50 | Maximum option delta for spreads |
| `STOP_LOSS_ATR_MULT` | 1.5 | ATR multiplier for stop losses |
| `TARGET_DAYS_TO_EXPIRY` | 45 | Target days to expiry for options |
| `MAX_SPREAD_COST` | 500 | Maximum cost per spread ($) |

## Environment Variables

The application supports using environment variables for sensitive configuration:

- `EMAIL_PASSWORD` - For email alert notifications
- `IB_ACCOUNT_ID` - Your IB account identifier

We recommend using a `.env` file with [python-dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/) to manage these variables.

### Security Note

**Important:** Never commit your `.env` file or any file containing credentials to version control. The repository includes a `.gitignore` file that excludes `.env` by default. For CI/CD pipelines, use environment secrets provided by your CI platform (like GitHub Secrets) rather than committing sensitive information.

## Usage

1. Start TWS or IB Gateway and ensure API connections are enabled.
2. Run the application:
   ```
   python runner.py
   ```
   
   Or if installed as a package:
   ```
   auto-trader
   ```

3. The system will:
   - Connect to Interactive Brokers
   - Load and filter the universe
   - Run scans after 3 PM ET each trading day
   - Place trades that meet all criteria
   - Monitor open positions for stop losses

### Quickstart Examples

**Run a specific scan without trading:**
```bash
python runner.py --scan bull_pullbacks
```

**Run the system in paper trading mode:**
```bash
python runner.py --paper
```

**Run in REPL or your own script:**
```python
from auto_vertical_spread_trader import AutoVerticalSpreadTrader

# Initialize the trader
trader = AutoVerticalSpreadTrader()
trader.initialize()

# Run specific scans
results = trader.run_scan("bull_pullbacks")
print(f"Found {len(results)} potential trades")

# Or run entries if during trading hours
trader.run_entries_if_time()
```

### Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

- **Connection Errors**: Ensure TWS/Gateway is running and API connections are enabled (Configure > API > Settings)

- **TA-Lib Installation Issues**: 
  - If encountering import errors, first try our `scripts/bootstrap_talib.sh` script
  - For "undefined symbol" errors on Linux, use the system package: `sudo apt-get install libta-lib-dev`
  - Common error: `ImportError: libta_lib.so.0: cannot open shared object file`
    - Run `sudo ldconfig` after installation to update the shared library cache
    - For Ubuntu/Debian, use the system package which handles this automatically
  - For Windows, using pre-built wheels is strongly recommended

- **Rate Limiting**: If you encounter "Pacing Violation" errors, increase the `QUERY_DELAY` in config.py

- **Missing Data**: For "No market data permissions" errors, ensure your IB account is subscribed to relevant data feeds

Check `auto_trader.log` for detailed error information.
