# Project Governance

This document outlines how the Auto Vertical Spread Trader project is governed.

## Project Maintainers

The project is currently maintained by:

- [Your Name](https://github.com/yourusername) - Lead maintainer

### Maintainer Responsibilities

Maintainers are responsible for:

- Reviewing and merging pull requests
- Triaging and addressing issues
- Making and approving design decisions
- Cutting new releases
- Ensuring the health and quality of the codebase
- Maintaining the project roadmap

## Decision Making Process

### Technical Decisions

- For minor changes, one maintainer approval is sufficient
- For significant changes (architecture, API changes), consensus among maintainers is required
- When consensus cannot be reached, the lead maintainer can make the final call

### Project Direction

Major project decisions are made through:

1. Opening an issue to propose the change
2. Discussion period of at least one week 
3. Resolution and documentation of the decision
4. Implementation of the change

## Contribution Workflow

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed contribution guidelines.

In brief:
1. Fork the repository
2. Make your changes in a branch
3. Submit a pull request
4. Maintainers will review the PR
5. After approval, maintainers will merge the changes

## Adding New Maintainers

New maintainers are added through the following process:

1. A candidate shows sustained, high-quality contributions to the project
2. Existing maintainers nominate and vote on the candidate
3. With consensus approval, the candidate is invited to become a maintainer
4. The new maintainer is added to the team and this document is updated

## Versioning and Releases

We follow semantic versioning:
- Patch releases (1.0.x) for bug fixes
- Minor releases (1.x.0) for new features
- Major releases (x.0.0) for breaking changes

Release candidates may be published for significant changes to gather feedback.

## Modifying Governance

Changes to this governance model require:
1. A proposal via issue or PR
2. At least one week of open discussion
3. Consensus among maintainers
4. Documentation of the changes
