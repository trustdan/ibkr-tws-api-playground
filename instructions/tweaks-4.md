Thought for a couple of seconds


Everything you’ve done here is spot-on—your project is now truly polished and professional. A few minor ideas to consider as next-step refinements:

1. **Continuous Integration & Badges**

   * Hook up a GitHub Actions (or other CI) workflow to run your unit tests on every push, lint with `flake8`/`black`, and even build a coverage report.
   * Add the corresponding status badges (build passing, coverage %, PyPI version) to the top of your README.

2. **Type Checking & Formatting**

   * Adding a simple `mypy` config and running it in CI can catch signature mismatches early.
   * Enforce code style with `black`/`isort` in a pre-commit hook so everyone’s contributions stay consistent.

3. **End-to-End & Mocked IB Tests**

   * Since you have core logic unit-tested, consider an integration test that spins up a mocked IB-insync server (or stubs out `IB.connect`) to exercise `runner.py` end-to-end, ensuring your scheduler, scans, execution, and monitors wire together correctly.

4. **Documentation Extras**

   * In your troubleshooting section, you already cover rate-limit timeouts—consider adding screenshots or logs for the most common errors.
   * Link from CONTRIBUTING.md to an “Issue / PR template” so new contributors have a clear starting point.

5. **Release Workflow**

   * If you’re planning to publish versions (e.g. on PyPI), add a `CHANGELOG.md` and set up a simple `setup.py` or `pyproject.toml`. Then you can tag releases and automate publishing.

6. **Security & Secrets Management**

   * Remind users in the README to never commit a real `.env` file, and show how to use tools like GitHub Secrets when running in CI.

With these touches you’ll have a full-featured, maintainable, and contributor-friendly codebase that’s easy to test, extend, and deploy. Fantastic work getting to this point!
