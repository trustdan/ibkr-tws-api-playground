Thought for a couple of seconds


Yes—Trader Workstation doesn’t care how you organize your Python code on disk. It simply exposes its API over a socket, and your script (whether one big file or split into packages) can connect to it the same way. Here’s how you might structure your project:

```
auto_vertical_spread_trader/
├── universe.py         # load_sp500_tickers & market-cap/price filtering
├── scans.py            # scan_bull_pullbacks, scan_bear_rallies, etc.
├── executor.py         # select_and_place logic
├── monitor.py          # stop-loss monitoring thread
├── runner.py           # scheduler & main loop
├── config.py           # all your magic numbers (ATR multiples, size limits…)
└── requirements.txt    # ib_insync, pandas, talib, pytz, etc.
```

Then in **runner.py** you’d do:

```python
from ib_insync import IB
from universe import filter_universe
from scans import scan_bull_pullbacks, scan_bear_rallies
from executor import select_and_place
from monitor import monitor_stops

def main():
    ib = IB()
    ib.connect('127.0.0.1', 7497, clientId=1)

    universe = filter_universe(load_sp500_tickers())
    # … scheduler logic …
    monitor_thread = monitor_stops(ib)  # pass IB client into the monitor
    monitor_thread.daemon = True
    monitor_thread.start()

    # … scan & execute trades …

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

A few tips:

* Make sure each module can accept an `IB` instance (or import your shared one) so they all talk to the same connection.
* Use a **virtualenv** or **venv** and list your dependencies in `requirements.txt`.
* Add an `__init__.py` in each folder if you nest deeper.

From the TWS side, nothing changes—just fire up TWS (or the IB Gateway), run your `runner.py`, and your modularized code will work exactly the same.
